**Problem Statement Number**: CBP16
**Problem Statement**: Optimizing doctor availability and appointment allocation in hospitals through digital technology and AI integration.
**Project Detail and Idea**: 
A web based application that overcomes the issue of managing and booking appointments according to patients's requirements. 
We will be differentiating the patients on the basis of their urgency. And according to the needs of the patient there will be an option for directly interacting with the doctor.
The task sometimes becomes very tedious for the compounder or doctor himself in manually allotting appointments for the users as per their availability.
Hence this project offers an effective solution where patients can view various booking slots available and select the preferred date and time.
The appointments will be saved in the backend, so that if any further issue arises in the future the diagnosis would be easier.
Patients can also search the doctor on the basis of their reviews given by other patients.
